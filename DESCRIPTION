Description: Functions that help with analysis of prognostic study data. This allows users with little experience of developing models to develop models and assess the performance of the prognostic models. This also summarises the information, so the performance of multiple models can be displayed simultaneously. Gurusamy, K (2026)<https://github.com/kurinchi2k/EQUALPrognosis>.
